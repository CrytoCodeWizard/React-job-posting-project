Resume vs Curriculum Vitae
Prior to updating your resume or curriculum vitae (CV), it is important to know which one a company prefers. The biggest difference between the two is that a resume is typically limited to one page, while a CV is usually two pages, three at the most. Resumes tend to be more to the point, while CVs allow you to expand on your qualifications, focusing on education, experience, research, publications, and awards.

Good First Impressions
Your resume or CV is the first impression a potential employer will have about you, so take the time to make sure your resume paints a complete and positive picture about who you are. Before sending out your resume or CV, look the piece over to ensure it’s professional and has no typos and is clearly written.
Find a Balance
One of the hardest parts about writing a resume or CV is finding the balance between talking yourself up and finding a balance in how much to embellish your achievements. You want to be sure everything you include on your resume is valid and is backed up by a reference, or exemplified by your own working knowledge or accolades.
Coordinate Your Resume for Each Job
While it may be easy to send out a carbon copy of your resume for every position you’re applying for, don’t.

Job Brown, IT & Web Manager at Wooden Blinds Direct, says, “as is the case in any job, tailor your CV to the specific role. Do as much research on the company as you can and see if you can find out what software they are using. Be sure to keep your CV broad, highlight specific pieces of software from your research of the job specification. Don’t forget to show your passion – IT is a vital part of practically every business today, but companies want people with a genuine flare and interest in the area, as well as the skills to do the job.”</p>
